Topics - fundamental problems in AI
- planning, e.g. auto driving path
	- example A: rover on mars
		- unknown terrain, no moving obstacles
	- example B: waymo
		- moving obstacles, obstacles of many different sizes
- graph search
- programming, dynamic/linear/integer
- learning, e.g. ML, DL, RL
- LLM, e.g. transformer, RAG
- data engineering (only about 2 weeks on this topic)
- etc.
