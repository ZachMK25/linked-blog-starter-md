## Review
### DP: Deterministic

### MDP: Stochastic
- recall: probabilities associated with actions
	- slightly random

<S, A, T, R>
S = State
A = Actions
T = Transition Probabilities
R = Reward


## Reinforcement Learning
We don't know transition probabilities (T) and sometimes we don't know reward (R)

Ï€: Policy that maps S --> a
