Topics - fundamental problems in AI
- planning, e.g. auto driving path
	- example A: rover on mars
		- unknown terrain, no moving obstacles
	- example B: waymo/autonomous driving
		- complex, high dimensional obstacles
- graph search
- programming, dynamic/linear/integer
- learning, e.g. ML, DL, RL
- LLM, e.g. transformer, RAG
- data engineering (only about 2 weeks on this topic)
- etc.

Prereq:
- basic data structures
	- graph, tree, etc.
- basics of probability
	- typical distributions, prob dist. function, mean and covariances of random variables
- comfortable with at least one of matlab, python, c++/c
	- implementing algos discussed in class
	- there will be NO coding support

# Grading
Participation/attendance: 5%

Homework: 20%
- 3-5 homeworks
- around 2 weeks to complete
- late penalties:
	- up to 1 hour late: 10% penalty
	- up to 24 hours late: 40% penalty
	- beyond 24 hours late: 100% penalty
- ## SUBMISSIONS DUE BY 9PM ON DUE DATE

Paper presentation (group): 15%
- select from a list, or propose a new one (w/ requirements)
- paper list will be posted on class website
- ways to get papers: google scholar, IEEE Xplore, arXiv
- goals:
	- convince audience you wrote the paper
	- we are not interested in a copy of the paper
	- tell us:
		- why paper is important
		- how it innovated
		- how you think it could be applied/extended
	- ~15 minutes
	- *everyone in class will be expected to have read the abstract and intro of the paper*
	- participation in the discussion time after each presentation will be expected throughout the year

Midterm: 30%
- in class, closed book

Final Project (group): 30%
- proposal (w/ short presentation) + presentations + report
- details:
	- proposal
		- 1-2 pages, IEEE conference format, word or latex, template will be provided
		- please describe what you want to do, what the challenges are, and why they are important
		- important: plan, deliverables

	- final project report: 
		- must be submitted as paper of 6 pages describing project outcome
		- project requirements given
		- **the project should ideally be the core of a potential conference paper submission**
