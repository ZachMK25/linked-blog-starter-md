## AI vs ML

**Well-posed Learning Problem**: "A computer is said to learn from experience (E) with respect to the same task (T) and some performance measure (P), if its performance on T as measured by P, improves with experience E"
- EXCLUSIVE to ML
- ML must LEARN

AI: 
- can be generalized for different tasks
- ex: GenAI can be applied to many different problems

ML:
- Model is designed for one task and one task only
