Motivation
- credit card fraud, medical anomalies, sensor/equipment failures

Types of Anomalies:
1. Point anomaly: single instance far from normal behavior. 
	1. Eg. Credit card amount
2. Contextual anomaly: Anomalous only in a specific context. 
	1. Eg. High temp in winter
3. Collective anomaly: A group of anomalous instances together. 
	1. Eg. DDoS

### Problem Formulation
typically very imbalanced classes (definition of anomaly)
#### Supervised anomaly detection:
- Training data contains normal and anomalous samples
- use classification
- example: credit fraud dataset

#### Unsupervised anomaly detection:
- no labels assumes anomalies are rare and dissimilar
- use clustering, density estimation, or reconstruction-based models
- ex: network intrusion

#### Semi-supervised:
- only normal data used for training; anomalies detected as deviations

#### Statistical approaches
- Assume data follows a known distribution p(x); anomalies have low likelihood
- example: gaussian model --> anomaly if p(x) < epsilon
- methods: Z-score, etc.

#### Distance based
- KNN
- idea: anomalies are far from others

#### clustering-based methods
- normal points belong to large clusters; anomalies are small or isolated clusters

#### autoencoder-based
- train autoencoder on normal data; anomalies --> large reconstruction error:
$$
L(x) = || x - \text{x-hat}||
$$
- threshold-based detection: anomaly if L(x) > Ï„

#### One Class SVM
- majority of the points are on the hyperplane
- points that aren't are the outliers

#### Density-based anomaly detection
- p(x) = "likelihood that x is generated by the same distribution as the training data"
