Goal: find patterns that describe data without labels
Unsupervised discovery

Ex: clustering images by common properties (plants with leaves and stems)

1. Clustering
	- Group data based on similarity
	- ex: customer segmentation
	- algos: k-means, DBSCAN, hierarchical
2. Association Rule Mining
	-  k
3. Summarization
	- compact representation of dataset
	- example: descriptive stats, top-10 keywords in text data
4. Outlier Detection
	- find unusual data points
	- ex: fraudulent credit card transactions
5. Sequential Pattern Mining
	- Discover patterns in sequential/temporal data
	- ex: clickstream analysis: user tends to visit *Home --> Product --> Checkout*
