Main Memory - only large storage media that the CPU can access directly
- **random access**
- typically **volatile**

Secondary storage - extension of main memory that provides large **nonvolatile** storage capacity

Hard disks - rigid metal or glass platters covered with magnetic recording material
- disk surface is logically divided into **tracks**, which are subdivided into sectors
- the **disk controller** determines the logical interaction between the device and the computer

**Solid State Disks** - faster than hard disks, nonvolatile
- various technologies
- becoming more popular
