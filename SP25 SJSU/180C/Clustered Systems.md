usually sharing storage via a **storage-area network (SAN)**

provides a **high-availability** service which survives failures
- **asymmetric clustering** has one machine in hot-standby

Some clusters are for **high-performance computing (HPC)**

Some have **distributed lock manager (DLM)** to avoid conflicting operations
