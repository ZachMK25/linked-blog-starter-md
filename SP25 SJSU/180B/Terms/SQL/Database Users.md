### Database Users  
#### Users may be divided into  
- Those who actually use and control the database content, and those who design, develop and maintain database applications (called “Actors on the Scene”), and  
- Those who design and develop the DBMS software and related tools, and the computer systems operators (called “Workers Behind the Scene”).
#### Actors on the scene  
**Database administrators**:  
- Responsible for authorizing access to the database, for coordinating and monitoring its use, acquiring software and hardware resources, controlling its use and monitoring efficiency of operations.  
**Database Designers**:
- Responsible to define the content, the structure, the constraints, and functions or transactions against the database. They must communicate with the end-users and understand their needs.

**End-users:** They use the data for queries, reports and some of them update the database content.  
- End-users can be categorized into:  
	- **Casual**: access database occasionally when needed  
	- **Naïve or Parametric**: they make up a large section of the end-user population. 
		- They use previously well-defined functions in the form of “canned transactions” against the database. 
		- Users of Mobile Apps mostly fall in this category 
		- Bank-tellers or reservation clerks are parametric users who do this activity for an entire shift of operations. 
		- Social Media Users post and read information from websites

	- **Sophisticated**:  
		- These include business analysts, scientists, engineers, others thoroughly familiar with the system capabilities.  
		- Many use tools in the form of software packages that work closely with the stored database.  
		- Stand-alone:  
			- Mostly maintain personal databases using ready-to-use packaged applications.
			- An example is the user of a tax program that creates its own internal database.  
			- Another example is a user that maintains a database of personal photos and videos.

System Analysts and Application Developers  
This category currently accounts for a very large proportion  
of the IT work force.  
◼ System Analysts: They understand the user  
requirements of naïve and sophisticated users and design  
applications including canned transactions to meet those  
requirements.  
◼ Application Programmers: Implement the  
specifications developed by analysts and test and debug  
them before deployment.  
◼ Business Analysts: There is an increasing need for  
such people who can analyze vast amounts of business  
data and real-time data (“Big Data”) for better decision  
making related to planning, advertising, marketing etc.


System Designers and Implementors: Design and  
implement DBMS packages in the form of modules and  
interfaces and test and debug them. The DBMS must interface  
with applications, language compilers, operating system  
components, etc.  
- Tool Developers: Design and implement software  
systems called tools for modeling and designing databases,  
performance monitoring, prototyping, test data generation,  
user interface creation, simulation etc. that facilitate building of  
applications and allow using database effectively.  
- Operators and Maintenance Personnel: They  
manage the actual running and maintenance of the database  
system hardware and software environment.
