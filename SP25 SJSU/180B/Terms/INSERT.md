inserts a tuple (row) in a relation (table)

attribute values should be listed in the same order as they are specified in the table

constraints on data tuples are observed automatically

any integrity constraints as a part of the DDL specification are enforced

ex: INSERT INTO Employee VALUES ("Richard", "K", "Marini", "523490845", "1962-10-1") etc...
