- Generalization of B+ trees to multi-dimensional data
- height balanced data structure
- search key for an R-tree is bounding box or rectangle
- Leaf nodes contain pointers to data objects
- Insertions and  Deletions are dynamic and can be done in any order
- spatial database contains a list of tuples
- each tuple has a unique identifier
- Search
	- need to compute a bounding box (BB)
	- x-low, y-low, x-high, y-high as coordinates/index
