**Database Management System**: A software package/ system to facilitate the creation and  
maintenance of a computerized [[Database]].

Typical [[DBMS]] Functionality:
- Define a particular database in terms of its data types, structures, and constraints  
	- Construct or Load the initial database contents on a secondary storage medium
	- Manipulating the database:
	- Retrieval: Querying, generating reports
	- Modification: Insertions, deletions and updates to its content
	- Accessing the database through Web applications
	- Processing and Sharing by a set of concurrent users and application programs â€“ yet, keeping all data valid and consistent

Applications interact with a [[database]] by generating:
- **Queries** that access different parts of [[data]] and formulate the result of a request
- **[[notes/SP25 SJSU/180B/Terms/Transaction]]** that may read some data and "update" certain values or generate new data and store that in the database

[[DBMS]] may additionally provide:
- Protection or security measures
- "Active" processing to take internal actions on data
- Presentation and visualization of data
- Maintenance of the database and associated programs over the lifetime of the applications
