Anthropos (man/human) + logos (study) = study of humans, their evolution and culture
Archaeos (primal, old, ancient) + logos (study) = study of the past = history

**culture**: extrasomatic (outside of the body) means and resources used to adapt to environment
- all of the behaviors and activities
	- food, social roles, clothing, etc.

Archaeology as Anthropology
- study of human behavior and culture patterns and their changes in time and space through the systematic and scientific study of material remains

Archaeological Theory
Archaeological Methods

Why do Archaeology?
- only discipline that can study 90% of human past (200kya-present)
- how do history, science, art, and sociology intersect?

What Arch is not:
- Indiana Jones and Dinosaurs
- Pseudoarchaeology
	- used to justify land theft, etc.
	- using false or nonexistent data
	- can be used for political or ideological purpose

Archaeology vs. History
- history is study of past through written records or images
	- biased toward literate poeple
- arbitrary divide
	- historical archaeology uses archaeological methods and evidence to fill in the "blindspots" in written record

(Jan 22)
### Creation of Deep Time
- monochronism vs polychronism
	- single, linear experience of time vs recursive, cyclical timeline
- relativity of "punctuality"

#### Antiquarianism
- students of the past, speculators, collects artifacts and manuscripts

#### Creationism
- James Ussher (1650): The earth was created 4004 BC by Judeo-Christian God

Conflicts between religious and archaeologists finding items older than the "Earth's Creation"

#### Catastrophism
- fossils and geological strata
- earth changed over a series of natural catastrophes (earthquakes, floods, etc.)

#### Uniformitarianism
- changes in geological layers result from uniform, gradual change on the earth's surface
- changes can be reconstructed using **stratigraphy**
	- **stratigraphy**: study of layers of soil and earth and archaeological material

### Explorers and Colonialism
- Layard's expedition to Nineveh and Nimrud (Syria) (mid 19th C)
- Napoleon's Egypt Expedition (1798-1801)

#### Archaeology's Colonial Legacy
- many stolen artifacts still not returned
- ongoing repatriation efforts

Three-Ages Model
- Stone Age, Bronze Age, Iron Age (1820s)
- foundational model for Euro History
- Stratigraphy and tech properties
Modern Excavation Techs
- controlled trenches
- removing sediments in layers
- record findings
Radiocarbon Dating
- establish calendar age for carbon-based materials

### Units of Arch Analysis: 
#### Artifacts
- stuff
- material culture
- portable object made/modified by humans
#### Ecofacts
- stuff that exists in the world that people have interacted with
- materials that acquire meaning through association with humans
- ex: burnt plant remains, stacks of logs

#### Feature
- **non-portable** remains that are altered or destroyed upon removal
	- platforms, building foundation, landfill
#### Site
- self-contained spatial cluster of features, artifacts, and ecofacts

#### Regions
- a group of sites that share common cultural attributes
- geographically circumscribed (valleys, plateaus, etc)

### Site Formation Processes
- distinguish between human and natural processes
- how much time has passed?
- why did people leave?
- "good" vs. "bad" contexts
- Who makes a site?
	- people
	- nature
		- **taphonomy**: natural and anthropogenic (human-made) processes that affect archaeological data AFTER behavioral processes are completed
- destruction of sites
	- anthropogenic transformations: looting, construction, reuse
- **Why does it matter?**
	- past human behavior + taphonomy = archaeological record
	- archaeological record - taphonomy = past human behavior
- **matrix**
	- physical medium surrounding artifacts/ecofacts/features
	- can be a mixture of clay, silt, sand, soil, carbon, ash, etc.
- what info does the "arch record" contain?
	- human behavior is inferred from the **association** of artifacts/features/sites with each other and their environments
	- to reconstruct association, we record
		- **provenience:** the 3D location of stuff in the matrix
		- **composition** of matrix
	- Artifacts + matrix + association = **context**
		- **Primary Contexts**:
			- undisturbed from original position (**in situ**)
		- **Secondary Contexts**:
			- altered provenience and association

### Research Design and Sampling Strategies
- facts:
	- the archaeological data universe is infinite
	- nonrenewable resources
	- life is short, money is tight
	- impossible to recover all info in arch record
	- archaeologists need to be clear about what they want to know
- **Data universe**: all arch data within a site
- **site sampling**: divided site
- Strategy 1: Judgmental Sampling (non-probabilistic)
	- pick "most interesting" site sections (e.g., parts with a pyramid)
- Strategy 2: Random Sampling
	- totally random sample of site sections
- Strategy 3: Stratified Sampling
	- combining the first 2

## Archaeological Survey: non-invasive archaeology
How to figure out where its worth to dig

**archaeological survey & remote sensing**
- locate and identify from/above the earth surface to
- identify sites and locate them in space (recon)
- obtain # something

(Proto-) survey: early exploration and travel
- provides a useful record site location by eyewitnesses

### Finding archaeological features from the air
- **cropmarks**: different colored shapes and outlines visible in fields
- **earthworks**: structures created with local soils and other raw materials

#### Aerial photography: DIY

#### Surface Survey
- getting a preview of what's below ground
- identifying different levels/episodes of occupation
- identifying features and architecture that can guide research design

#### Probing: excavating just a tiny bit
- preview of layers below ground (+)
- access to artifacts (+)
- not comprehensive (very small area) (-)

## Archaeological Excavation 1-29

### Today: "A day in the field"
- excavation: what to do in the trenches
- recording the past: so much paperwork
- stratigraphy: the law of x
- unfinished

### Archaeology is an early morning business
- dress for local weather
- lots of sunscreen and hat
- get comfy
- squeeze in
- ergonomic nightmare

### Field Archaeology: low-tech & DIY
- starting an excavation:
	- where on the site?
	- how large of an area?

### Archaeologists think "inside the square"
- specific area to control context
- to make quantification of volume easier, usually square
	- e.g., 1 sherd/1m^2 < 1 sherd / 100m^2

### Provenience Control
- gradually remove **horizontal** layers (levels or strata) of matrix
- maintain as much info about **provenience and association** as possible

### How deep to dig?
- **Control provenience** (depth)
- until the matrix changes (**natural stratum**)
- until the provenience becomes too large to control reliably (**arbitrary stratum**)

### What to do after finding it?
- standardized forms
	- elevation, soil composition, soil texture, etc
- notes
- logs
	- narrative description of what happened while excavating
- photographs

### Before you take out the artifact
- record provenience
	- horizontal
		- 2D X and Y
	- vertical

### Screening
- recovering artifacts from excavating matrix
- no exact provenience but at least associated with stratum
- catch small things excavators don't see

### At the bottom of the unit
- after all strata are removed: an empty unit with one important resource: unexcavated matrix **outside of unit!**
- **Stratification**: layering of matrices and features
	- sequence of strata from bottom to top reflects the order of deposition from earliest to latest **(sequence of strata *not* artifacts)**
	- exceptions (e.g., inverted stratigraphy, rodent burrows)

### Stratigraphy
- = interpretation
	- archaeological evaluation of temporal and functional meaning of the observed strata
	- => site formation processes
	- "profiles"

### Classification
- arranging and ordering objects into groups based on shared attributes
	- ease of curation, collection management, analysis
	- establishes *similarities* (shared attributes) and *relationships* between artifacts
- technological attributes
	- raw materials, manufacture
- form attributes
	- shape, dimensions
- stylistic attributes
	- color, texture, decorations, etc.

### Caring for the past: ethics in archaeology
- excavating responsibility = assuming custody of the artifact


## Ethnoarchaeology

### assumptions of anthropological archaeology
1. modern human behavior
2. suitability of comparison
3. past knowable through the material record

### the science of connecting the past and present
- study of ethnographic or historical situations through direct observation or documentary evidence to extract info useful for understanding the relationship

### just a lot of common sense
- we use analogy in the field all the time
	- identifying and classifying sites, features, artifacts

### Garbology
- study of trash
- refuse: by-product of human activity and its disposal = universal
- refuse is in the eye of the beholder
- social norms of refuse disposal
- refuse shapes behavior

### behavioral patterns in trash

### where to look: events connected to the present
- occupy movement
	- social conflict
	- shine light on "hidden lives"
	- community formation processes
- burning man festival
	- "instant" organization
	- what remains after the party?

### getting more specific: direct historical approach
- searching for hypothetical analogues to archaeological situations in geographic areas characterized by long-term cultural continuity
	- (can - but doesn't have to - include experimental archaeology)
- alcohol/fermented drinks


### pitfalls of ethnoarchaeology
- life is complicated
	- people make idiosyncratic decisions
- assumptions that cultures as we see them are static
- what about historical contingencies and cultural specificities? can we account for everything between then and now?

### takeaways
- arcaheology relies on assumptions about the past and present human behvaior
- we can recreate the steps adn processes that underlie artifacts
- some humans...


## GenderLithics 2-5
### Why
- Stone tools
	- how are they made?
	- from what?
	- for what or whom?
- ppl wielding the tools
	- why should they always be men?
	- where are the women?
	- what were they doing?

### Challenging an old trope: Man, the hunter
- sex (biological) and gender (social/cultural) matter to individual's experience

**Gender Archaeology**
- approach to study material culture as produced by **and** actively reproducing gender identities and relations in past societies
	- burials
	- bodies
	- art and iconography
	- ethnoarchaeology
	- material analyses
	- gender and feminist theories
### stone tools are amazing bc:
- durable
- ubiquitous
- conservative in their making
- convey information about
	- production
		- economic networks and tech traditions and innovation
	- function/use 
		- activities (food, production, and defense)
	- style
		- identity of their makers and users

### material
- "ideal" material for lithics
	- hard
	- homogenous
	- non-resilient
- examples
	- flint
	- quartz
	- obsidian
	- chert

### Gendered lithic typologies
- women
	- ground stone tools
		- grinding
		- mashing
		- crushing
		- processing
	- near living space
	- non-portable
- men
	- chipped stone tools
	- anything related to hunting and fishing
	- portable

### step-by-step reduction sequence
- strike off flake from core surface (cortex) => primary reduction
- secondary reduction
- sharpening edge (retouching)
	- can make serrated edges
	- (re)sharpens edge

### Lithic production makes a lot of garbage
- artifacts + debitage = **lithic assemblage**
	- debitage = scraps/debris
	- composition of assemblage => types of human activities

### Lithic landscapes
- quarry
- workshop
- kill site

### Why only hunting?
- stone tech remained popular for a very long time, especially in areas without metal ore/production
- stone tools often part of composite tools to specialize or increase functionality
- current thoughts on gendered divisions of labor in farming society probably as biased and unsupported as those for hunter-gatherers

## Pottery & People

### Beginning of Ceramic Technology

### Today: (Re-)Production of Identity
- manufacture and craft learning
- ceramic assemblages and feasting
- decoration

### Anatomy of a pot/sherd
- sherd = piece of pottery (shard = piece of glass)
- inclusions/temper
- shape & decoration
- clay
- porosity
- color

### Ceramic style and the expression of identity
- style is
	- a means of communication
	- a personal/communal choice of material expression of identity
	- a marker of status (hierarchical) vs. group affinity (non-hierarchical)
- pottery often associated with food: form & content
- technology offers many ways to express identity


### Materials Matter: How tot study ceramic composition
- petrographic analysis
	- microscopic study of clay and temper minerals
- NAA/ICP-MS

### (In)Visible Social Networks in Eastern North America
- Appalachian region (AD 800-1600): different surface & different temper => different social networks
- surface treatment is visible (signaling)

### Bonding and Bridging: Making vs. Make-Belief

### Making Pottery and Potters in the Southwest
- ethnography & history
	- puebloan craft is collaborative
	- master craftspeople

### Mesopotamian Politics of Consumption
- Bevel-rimmed bowls
	- ~ styrofoam of today
	- ugly, unslipped, disposable
	- mold-made
	- standard size
- Standardized production
	- standardized unit of food/drink (beer, bread)
	- fast manufacture
	- easy replacement

### Synthetic Tech
- resource networks
- learning processes
- food consumption & distribution
- marking and communicating social differences
