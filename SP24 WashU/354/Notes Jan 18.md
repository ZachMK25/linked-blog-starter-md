## What is a crime?
- actions that break cohesion of society
- actions that harm social welfare
- Ex: Theft
	- Econ Approach:
	- Costs (private)
		- **Risk of being caught**s
			- probability of being caught
				- unwieldy item
				- security
				- skill
				- own reputation
				- policing/detectives
		- victim is mad
		- effort
		- **opportunity cost**
	- Benefits (private)
		- get the thing
		- victim is mad
		- social signal (gang initiation)
		- thrilling
	- Social Costs
		- sentimental value of items to victim

### Utility of Crime U<sub>c</sub>
- U<sub>c</sub> = (1-p)b - pc
- commit crime if: U<sub>c</sub> > U<sub>NC</sub> (not crime)

### Comparative Statics
- b increase -> increase in crime
- c increase -> decrease in crime
- p increase -> decrease in crime
- U<sub>NC</sub> increase -> decrease in crime

### Crime Control Policies
#### Deterrence
- increased sentences
- margin matters
	- marginal benefit if c is already large

#### Enforcement
- increase P
- complementary with deterrence - you need *both*

#### Incapacitation
- remove the choice
- can't take to extremes

#### Rehabilitation
- decrease b or increase U<sub>NC</sub> 
- **after** committing crime

#### Diversion
- preemptive rehabilitation
- mostly through U<sub>NC</sub>

### Why not all at once?
- budget
	- all need money (finite resource)
- inherent limit on incapacitation
- some policies are opposing
	- deterrence vs rehabilitation

### What do *we* do *currently*?
- nominally, rehab
- in practice, mostly deterrence + incapacitation
- prison blends all 3
- Mortinson report (1974) what works in rehab? "nothing works"
	- can lead to slide from rehab emphasis to deterrence + incapacitation

## Point of Model
- organize thoughts
- p,c complementary
- force consideration of outside option, U<sub>NC</sub>
