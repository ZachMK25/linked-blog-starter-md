arrest: a is 0 or 1
pr=probability
a (pr{good arrest} - pr{bad arrest} x V)+ (1-a)*0

arrest if pr{good arrest} - pr{bad arrest} x V > 0

where V is some value representing the harm done for a bad arrest (rights violated, costs associated with arrest, etc.)

V is determined by the officer -> may differ from value assigned by society
