## Prison Boom and Lack of Black Progress after Smith and Welch (1989)

### Abstract
- trend of black progress did not continue after 1940-1980 growth
	- incarceration rates 1980-2016 increased
	- employment rates down to 1965 levels after Great Recession (2008)
	- correction policies have had much larger impact on black communities compared to white

### Intro
- Smith and Welch noted that Black education rates grew, though schools were still a limiting factor
- Drastically different rates of institutionalization (incarceration, mental hospital, nursing home) compared to white population
	- 2010: 1/10 black males 20-39 institutionalized
	- 2010: 1/3 high school dropout black males institutionalized, 1/4 employed

> In sum, among less educated men, rates of institutionalization have increased for both blacks and whites at all ages. Further, among both black and white dropouts, we see employment levels among men over 40 that are strikingly low by historical standards. Nonetheless, because the black samples contain proportionally more dropouts and even worse trends in outcomes among dropouts, these trends contribute to growing inequality between black and white men.

### Recent History of Trends in Criminal Justice Policy
- **Indeterminant Sentencing** - judges' discretion on probation vs prison, as well as prison sentence length
	- parole boards also had lost of freedom in their judgement
- 1994: **Truth-in-Sentencing** Incentive Grants Program: provided grants for prison construction and expansion to states that adopted policies requiring sentences offenders to serve a larger portion of their sentences. 
- California's **Three Strike Policy** - increased sentences for repeat offenders
#### Recent Leveling
- *Blakely v. Washington* (2004) - any factors judges rely on for sentencing must be proven beyond reasonable doubt to a jury
- *United States v. Booker* (2005) - same principle applies to fed. judges
- *Brown v. Plata* (2011) - USSC upheld decision against California's overcrowded prisons
#### Empirical Literature on the Effects of Specific Laws
- Zhang, Maxwell, and Vaugn (2009)
	- conclude that sentencing policies (voluntary sentencing guidelines, presumptive sentencing guidelines, habitual offender laws, abolitions of discretionary release by parole boards, requirements that sentencing guidelines consider prison capacity, truth-in-sentencing laws) associated with determinacy did not contribute much to prison growth over the period 1973-1998
