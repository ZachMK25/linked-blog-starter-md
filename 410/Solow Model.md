Lecture 3
- Cobb-Douglas
- Solow Model

## Numerical Example
- consider the discrete version of the fundamental equation of the Solow Model:
	- k(t+1) - k (t) = sk(t)^a - (d+n) k(t)
		- Let a = 1/3, s = 0.2, d = 0.06, n = 0.02
		- consider 2 econs: 1) a developed econ that is in the steady state
			- ie EQ1
			- #onslides


## Questions
- Is Solow model a good theory of growth?
- good theory of world ineq?
- (opt) what determines the saving rate?

Increasing Saving Rates, s' > s
- short run, increase in growth rate in capital per capita
- graph #onslides

Investment and Growth
- positively correlated

Increasing Population Growth, n' > n
- short run, decrease in growth rate in capital per capita
- graph #onslides

Theory
- countries with lower capital per capita should grow faster
- conditional convergence

Determining A
- Physical capital
	- machines, etc.
- human capital
	- education

Saving Rate
- choosing consumption between today and tomorrow
-
