- why do it this way?
	- police officers are not the same as judges

- Advancement decision is #diagram


## A variation
- some fixed "success"
- success gives benefit *b*
- cost of advancement *c*
- probability of success q<sub>i</sub>

What can we observe?
- p*<sub>i</sub> for all i
- mean of q<sub>i</sub> when p<sub>i</sub> = i
